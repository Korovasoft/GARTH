OVERVIEW

Garth is designed as a framework for writing customized highly parallel
genetic algorithm software. It is designed to be incorporated into
your existing simulation or research software as an optimization addon.

Garth can also be treated as a standalone GA toolkit, requiring only
that one write a fitness function plugin. It comes equipped with a 
web application called the Monitor which allows you to design, deploy
and of course monitor genetic algorithms experiments.

ARCHITECTURE

Garth is designed in a highly modular fashion, making it easy to customize
specific components of the genetic algorithms process to your needs. 

For example, the most common situation is that your fitness measure will
need to be determined by some outside software package. This is a big 
hurdle for GA toolkits that require you to write your fitness functions
in a hand-rolled scripting language. With Garth, you simply write a module
that bridges your existing software to garth by taking in a byte array
representing the genome and returning the fitness score as determined by
your outside software.
